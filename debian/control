Description: Fixed-point MP3 encoding library - runtime files
 Shine can be used to encode audio data on architectures with no floating
 point processing unit (FPU) at a much better rate than encoding
 libraries implemented using floating-point arithmetic.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to run a program compiled using
 Shine.
